	<h1>Lab 3: File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
	<p>This lab was about learning to familiarize ourselves with the file
		structure that Wes provided us. As well as how to create an index page for
		our website.</p>
	<h1>Problems With the Lab</h1>
	<p>At first we did not know how to insert an image into our img folder.
		We looked at WS3 schools and a youtube video and were able to not only
		figure out how to link it but also learn what some new attributes. </p>
	<h1>Results</h1>
	<p>As shoddy as this website is I have succesfully linked my lab3 to my index
		 page which has resulted in this. </p>
