    <h1>My Interests</h1>
    <p>I have been a Mexican Folklorico dancer for the past 4 years now. It's a really fun way to be connected to my culture while also staying active.</p>
    <p>I also enjoy hiking! Hiking became a passion of mine after my friends introduced it to me. Unfortuntely I have not found the time to hike as much as I would like to while at UCSC</p>
