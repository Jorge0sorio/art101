    <h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>Our console was not working so we had to move on to Task 2.</p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>At first we tried copying and pasting our Lab 5 variables but that
          led to a kurfuffle of problems we didn't realize for about an hour.
          The issue was a bunch of syntax errors.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>We were able to deliver Tasks 2 and Task 3 as seen here and in our
           deliverables.</p>
