    <h2>Debugging</h2>
        <p>I am very proud that I debugged Lab 9. It was a welcome challenge
          from Nicki and quite frankly I didn't think that our TA's would tell
          us to go back and fix labs. I'm glad I had the opprotunity presented
          to me because I learned how important it is to designate an id. Sure
          I had a few syntax errors but my crux was definitely that id that
           wasn't working. </p>
