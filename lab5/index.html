			<h1><center>Challenge</center></h1>
					<p>Our challenge was maintaining our console orderly. At first we were
						 confused on whether or no we needed to include var in the console.
						 After trial and error we concluded that it was not necessary.</p>
			<h1><center>Problems</center></h1>
					<p>Issues we faced were determining what words were necessary to
						include in our Java Script. As discussed in class by Professor
						Modes, the conscole will make assumptions on what you are trying to
						do. At a certain point we trusted the process and let Java Script
						takeover.</p>
			<h1><center>Results</center></h1>
					<p>We were able to have a really neat list generated from our
						Javascript. So now I have a really cool new way to make lists!</p>
